# Ralph Progress Log
Started: Initial setup
---

## Codebase Patterns
- Multi-tenant: every DB query must filter by tenantId
- Auth: NextAuth v5 with getServerSession, session includes tenantId
- tRPC routers in server/api/trpc/routers/, registered in _app.ts
- API routes (non-tRPC) in app/api/
- UI components: shadcn/ui from @/components/ui/
- Pages: app/(dashboard)/ for authenticated, app/(auth)/ for login/register
- Prisma client: import from @/lib/prisma (singleton pattern)
- Existing Subscription model in schema.prisma (line ~189)
- Registration flow: app/api/register/route.ts
- Navigation: components/navigation.tsx
- Middleware: middleware.ts (route protection)
